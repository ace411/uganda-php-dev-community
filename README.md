# Uganda PHP Developer Community Resources 
A collection of resources, information on the PHP and Laravel communities in Uganda

## Overview 

As a self confessed PHP lover, and community builder I am hoping that this can be a resource for finding out who is
using PHP in Uganda what they are doing, and will hopefully grow into a full blown community at some point 

What can you do? Add your details to the [data.js](src/data.js) file by sending a PR to this project as I look into automation 

## Inspiration 
The inspiration is drawn from [WesBos Awesome Uses](https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses) which is compiled into the 
[uses.tech](https://uses.tech) site so I am hoping to reuse as much as I can from there. I am Javascript handicapped so
I am happily accepting PRs to get that done!!!
